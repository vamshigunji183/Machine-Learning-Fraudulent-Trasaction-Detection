# Credit Card Fraud Detection

Three models trained to label anonymized credit card transactions as fraudulent or genuine. Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dalpozz/creditcardfraud). Project through [ML@B](https://ml.berkeley.edu).

* Problem: Fraudulent transaction detection
* Challenges: Imbalance data, time series transactional data
* Goal: Well performing model with low FN misclassification
* Algorithms: Neural networks, K-Means, Logistic Regression
* Concepts: PCA, Oversampling, hyperparameter tuning, Confusion matrix, Gaussian Noise
